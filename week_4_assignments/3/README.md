## Introduction
Welcome to the E-commerce Data Analysis project! This project is designed to help you analyze and gain insights from your e-commerce sales data. With this toolkit, you can explore product performance, customer behavior, and generate informative reports to make data-driven decisions for your business.

## Project Overview
The project consists of several key components:

1. `e-commerce.csv`: This file contains your e-commerce sales data. It serves as the source of information for analysis.

2. `db_config.py`: This script sets up the PostgreSQL database and defines the SQLAlchemy model for storing sales data.

3. `load_data.py`: The script responsible for loading data from the CSV file into the PostgreSQL database, ensuring your data is ready for analysis.

4. `main.py`: The main script that provides a command-line interface for various data analysis tasks. You can use it to retrieve product information, customer details, and generate sales reports.
